## ADMINER

[AdminerEvo](https://github.com/adminerevo/adminerevo) is a web-based database management interface, with a focus on security, user experience, performance, functionality and size.
It works out of the box with MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, Elasticsearch and MongoDB. In addition, there are plugins for SimpleDB, Firebird and ClickHouse.

AdminerEvo is developed by the AdminerEvo community and is a continuation of the Adminer project by Jakub Vr√°na.


## Production vs. development

- For production environments, it is not advisable to make Adminer publicly accessible. Consider either disabling ```Public Access through the Zerops.io subdomain```  after deployment in GUI  or directly setting `enableSubdomainAccess` to `false` in import file.
- To access Adminer in production environment you can use a  [VPN](https://docs.zerops.io/references/vpn) through [ZCLI](https://docs.zerops.io/references/cli). Once connected, Adminer will be available at the address `adminer.zerops` (or whatever hostname you set).
